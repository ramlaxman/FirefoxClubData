Outreachy is a program for girls, transgenders and underprivileged people in any area of world. 

Application process has started from August 20. 

Actual Development timeline starts from December and ends on March.

### A note from my side:

**It is not possible for such competitions to tell everything. That's what this program about, Self Learning!**

**You need to read a lot and learn at your own.**

**From my side, I can tell you must know about at least** 

- ***Any one programming language [Python, JS, C++, Java]*** 
- ***GitHub basics***
- ***Linux Commands and Handling***
- ***Google Docs, Hangout & Slides for Presentation.***

*After this, you are having any queries kindly email me with specific queries or you can directly discuss with me in person on Saturday.*

**If you are giving your best, I bet it will be a wonderful experience for you.**
